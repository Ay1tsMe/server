"""
DEMO/TEST/DUMMY/TEMPLATE Player Provider for Music Assistant.

This is an empty player provider with a test/demo implementation.
Its meant to get started developing a new player provider for Music Assistant.

Use it as a reference to discover what methods exists and what they should return.
Also it is good to look at existing player providers to get a better understanding,
due to the fact that providers may be flexible and support different features and/or
ways to discover players on the network.

In general, the actual device communication should reside in a separate library.
You can then reference your library in the manifest in the requirements section,
which is a list of (versioned!) python modules (pip syntax) that should be installed
when the provider is selected by the user.

To add a new player provider to Music Assistant, you need to create a new folder
in the providers folder with the name of your provider (e.g. 'my_player_provider').
In that folder you should create (at least) a __init__.py file and a manifest.json file.

Optional is an icon.svg file that will be used as the icon for the provider in the UI,
but we also support that you specify a material design icon in the manifest.json file.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
We strongly recommend developing on either macOS or Linux and start your development
environment by running the setup.sh scripts in the scripts folder of the repository.
This will create a virtual environment and install all dependencies needed for development.

For all development instructions, please refer to the developer documentation:
