# Release Notes Generation - Channel-Specific Behavior

## Overview

The release workflow generates release notes **specific to each channel** by only including commits since the last release of that same channel. It uses your **Release Drafter configuration** (`.github/release-drafter.yml`) for label-based categorization.

## How It Works

### 1. Previous Release Detection

The workflow identifies the previous release for each channel using tag patterns:

#### Stable Channel
- **Pattern**: `^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$` (e.g., `2.1.0`, `2.0.5`)
- **Branch**: `stable`
- **Finds**: Latest stable release (no suffix)

#### Beta Channel
- **Pattern**: `^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.b[0-9]+$` (e.g., `2.1.0.b1`, `2.1.0.b2`)
- **Branch**: `dev`
- **Finds**: Latest beta release (`.bN` suffix)

#### Nightly Channel
- **Pattern**: `^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.dev[0-9]+$` (e.g., `2.1.0.dev20251023`)
- **Branch**: `dev`
- **Finds**: Latest nightly release (`.devYYYYMMDD` suffix)

### 2. Release Notes Generation

The workflow generates notes in three steps:

1. **Find PRs in commit range**: Extracts PR numbers from merge commits between the previous tag and HEAD
2. **Categorize by labels**: Applies the category rules from `.github/release-drafter.yml`:
   - ‚ö† Breaking Changes (`breaking-change` label)
   - üöÄ New Providers (`new-provider` label)
   - üöÄ Features and enhancements (`feature`, `enhancement`, `new-feature` labels)
   - üêõ Bugfixes (`bugfix` label)
   - üß∞ Maintenance (`ci`, `documentation`, `maintenance`, `dependencies` labels)
3. **Add contributors**: Lists all unique contributors from the PRs

### 3. What This Means

#### ‚úÖ Stable Release Notes
- Include **only commits since the last stable release**
- **Do NOT include** beta or nightly commits that happened in between
- Example: `2.0.5` ‚Üí `2.1.0` only shows stable branch commits

#### ‚úÖ Beta Release Notes
- Include **only commits since the last beta release**
- **Do NOT include** nightly commits
- **Do NOT include** stable commits from stable branch
- Example: `2.1.0.b2` ‚Üí `2.1.0.b3` only shows dev branch commits since b2

#### ‚úÖ Nightly Release Notes
- Include **only commits since the last nightly release**
- **Do NOT include** beta or stable releases in between
- Example: `2.1.0.dev20251022` ‚Üí `2.1.0.dev20251023` only shows dev branch commits since yesterday

## Release Drafter Configuration

‚úÖ The workflow **uses your `.github/release-drafter.yml` configuration** for:
- Category definitions (labels ‚Üí section headers)
- Category titles and emoji
- Excluded contributors (bots)
- PR title format

The workflow manually implements the categorization logic to ensure channel-specific commit ranges while preserving your custom formatting.

## Example Release Notes Format

## Testing

To verify channel-specific release notes:

1. **Create a beta release** after a stable release:
   ```bash
   # Should only show commits on dev branch since last beta
   # Should NOT include stable branch commits
   ```

2. **Create a nightly release** after a beta release:
   ```bash
   # Should only show commits since yesterday's nightly
   # Should NOT include beta release notes
   ```

3. **Create a stable release** after multiple betas:
   ```bash
   # Should only show commits on stable branch since last stable
   # Should NOT include any beta or nightly commits
   ```

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check what will be in next stable release
git log $(git tag | grep -E '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$' | sort -V | tail -1)..stable --oneline

# Check what will be in next beta release
git log $(git tag | grep -E '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.b[0-9]+$' | sort -V | tail -1)..dev --oneline

# Check what will be in next nightly release
git log $(git tag | grep -E '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.dev[0-9]+$' | sort -V | tail -1)..dev --oneline
```

git log $(git tag | grep -E '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.dev[0-9]+$' | sort -V | tail -1)..dev --oneline
